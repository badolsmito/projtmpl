# ProjTmpl

ProjTmpl is a tool that allows the quick and easy set up of projects using an easy-to-configure TOML file for templates.

## Dependencies

ProjTmpl uses the following dependencies:
  - [{fmt}](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt) for I/O
  - [Argh!](https://github.com/adishavit/argh) for argument parsing
  - [toml11](https://github.com/ToruNiina/toml11) for parsing and working with TOML files

If you do not have {fmt} installed in your system, you will have to install it manually. Note that I'm developing on Ubuntu 22.
